We collect a high quality dataset of news articles available in English and Spanish, written for diverse grade levels and propose a method to align segments across comparable bilingual articles. The resulting dataset makes it possible to train multi-task sequence to sequence models that can translate and simplify text jointly. We show that these multi-task models outperform pipeline approaches that translate and simplify text independently.","tags":null,"title":"Controlling Text Complexity in Neural Machine Translation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sweta Agrawal","Amit Awekar"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1522108800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1522108800,"objectID":"c1f1cc1516bc29527b21c7394a63fbd6","permalink":"/publication/cyber-bullying/","publishdate":"2018-03-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cyber-bullying/","section":"publication","summary":"Harassment by cyberbullies is a significant phenomenon onthe social media. Existing works for cyberbullying detection have at least one of the following three bottlenecks. First, they target only one particular social media platform (SMP). Second, they address just one topic of cyberbullying.Third, they rely on carefully handcrafted features of the data. We show that deep learning based models can overcome all three bottlenecks. Knowledge learned by these models on one dataset can be transferred to other datasets. We performed extensive experiments using three real-world datasets: Formspring (~12k posts), Twitter (~16k posts), and Wikipedia(~100k posts). Our experiments provide several useful insights about cyberbullying detection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that systematically analyzes cyberbullying detection on various topics across multiple SMPs using deep learning based models and transfer learning.","tags":null,"title":"Deep Learning for Detecting Cyberbullying Across Multiple Social Media Platforms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ankur Garg","Sunav Choudhary","Payal Bajaj","Sweta Agrawal","Abhishek Kedia","Shubham Agarwal"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1510012800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1510012800,"objectID":"33aacc144cd1618d7582cef0f9094b79","permalink":"/publication/geo-fencing/","publishdate":"2017-11-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/geo-fencing/","section":"publication","summary":"Geo-fencing is a location based service that allows sending of messages to users who enter/exit a specified geographical area, known as a geo-fence. Today, it has become one of the popular location based mobile marketing strategies. However, the process of geofencing is presently manual, i.e. a retailer has to specify the location and the radius of area around it to setup the geo-fences. In addition, this process does not take into account the user’s preference towards the targeted product/service and thus, can compromise his/her experience of the app that sends these communications. We attempt to solve this problem by presenting a novel end-to-end system for automated creation of affinity based smart geo-fences. Affinity towards a product/service refers to the user’s interest in a product/service. Our unique formulation to estimate affinity, using historical app usage data, is sensitive to a user’s location as well and thus, the affinity is termed as location sensitive product affinity (LSPA). The geo-fence logic tries to capture contiguous groups of locations where the affinity is high. Experiments on real world ecommerce dataset reveals that geo-fences designed by our approach performs signiffcantly better at accurately targeting the users who are interested in a product. We thus show that, using historical app usage data, geo-fences can be created in an automated manner and help enterprises target interested users with better accuracy as compared to the present industry practices.","tags":null,"title":"Smart Geo-fencing with Location Sensitive Product Affinity","type":"publication"}]
