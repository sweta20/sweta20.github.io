In principle, evaluations by human raters should be the most reliable.  However, we find that, in style transfer papers, protocols for human evaluations are often underspecified and not standardized, which hampers the reproducibility of research in this field and progress toward better human and automatic evaluation methods.","tags":null,"title":"A Review of Human Evaluation for Style Transfer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sweta Agrawal","George Foster","Markus Freitag","Colin Cherry"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1618185600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618185600,"objectID":"bba7f8d34adda183f3b6e78060bb3cd6","permalink":"/publication/reference-free/","publishdate":"2021-04-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/reference-free/","section":"publication","summary":"Reference-free evaluation has the potential to make machine translation evaluation substantially more scalable, allowing us to pivot easily to new languages or domains. It has been recently shown that the probabilities given by a large, multilingual model can achieve state of the art results when used as a reference-free metric. We experiment with various modifications to this model, and demonstrate that by scaling it up we can match the performance of BLEU. We analyze various potential weaknesses of the approach, and find that it is surprisingly robust and likely to offer reasonable performance across a broad spectrum of domains and different system qualities.","tags":null,"title":"Assessing Reference-Free Peer Evaluation for Machine Translation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sweta Agrawal","Marine Carpuat"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1593993600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593993600,"objectID":"41ea75ce7e3367a8117753a88f434bda","permalink":"/publication/duolingo/","publishdate":"2020-07-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/duolingo/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper describes the University of Maryland’s submission to the Duolingo Shared Task on Simultaneous Translation And Paraphrase for Language Education (STAPLE). Unlike the standard machine translation task, STAPLE requires generating a set of outputs for a given input sequence, aiming to cover the space of translations produced by language learners. We adapt neural machine translation models to this requirement by (a) generating n-best translation hypotheses from a model fine-tuned on learner translations, oversampled to reflect the distribution of learner responses, and (b) filtering hypotheses using a feature-rich binary classifier that directly optimizes a close approximation of the official evaluation metric. Combination of systems that use these two strategies achieves F1 scores of 53.9% and 52.5% on Vietnamese and Portuguese, respectively ranking 2nd and 4th on the leaderboard.","tags":null,"title":"Generating diverse translations via weighted fine-tuning and hypotheses filtering for the Duolingo STAPLE task","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sweta Agrawal","Marine Carpuat"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1572739200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572739200,"objectID":"2ff4e8d289ea2dd1e728d052b97dfa9b","permalink":"/publication/complexity-mt/","publishdate":"2019-11-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/complexity-mt/","section":"publication","summary":"This work introduces a machine translation task where the output is aimed at audiences of different levels of target language proficiency.

Existing works for cyberbullying detection have at least one of the following three bottlenecks. First, they target only one particular social media platform (SMP). Second, they address just one topic of cyberbullying.Third, they rely on carefully handcrafted features of the data. We show that deep learning based models can overcome all three bottlenecks. Knowledge learned by these models on one dataset can be transferred to other datasets. We performed extensive experiments using three real-world datasets: Formspring (~12k posts), Twitter (~16k posts), and Wikipedia(~100k posts). Our experiments provide several useful insights about cyberbullying detection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that systematically analyzes cyberbullying detection on various topics across multiple SMPs using deep learning based models and transfer learning.","tags":null,"title":"Deep Learning for Detecting Cyberbullying Across Multiple Social Media Platforms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ankur Garg","Sunav Choudhary","Payal Bajaj","Sweta Agrawal","Abhishek Kedia","Shubham Agarwal"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1510012800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1510012800,"objectID":"33aacc144cd1618d7582cef0f9094b79","permalink":"/publication/geo-fencing/","publishdate":"2017-11-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/geo-fencing/","section":"publication","summary":"Geo-fencing is a location based service that allows sending of messages to users who enter/exit a specified geographical area, known as a geo-fence. Today, it has become one of the popular location based mobile marketing strategies. However, the process of geofencing is presently manual, i.e. a retailer has to specify the location and the radius of area around it to setup the geo-fences. In addition, this process does not take into account the user’s preference towards the targeted product/service and thus, can compromise his/her experience of the app that sends these communications. We attempt to solve this problem by presenting a novel end-to-end system for automated creation of affnity based smart geo-fences. Affnity towards a product/service refers to the user’s interest in a product/service. Our unique formulation to estimate affnity, using historical app usage data, is sensitive to a user’s location as well and thus, the affnity is termed as location sensitive product affnity (LSPA). The geo-fence logic tries to capture contiguous groups of locations where the affnity high. Experiments on real world ecommerce dataset reveals that geo-fences designed by our approach performs signiffcantly better at accurately targeting the users who are interested in a product. We thus show that, using historical app usage data, geo-fences can be created in an automated manner and help enterprises target interested users with better accuracy as compared to the present industry practices.","tags":null,"title":"Smart Geo-fencing with Location Sensitive Product Affinity","type":"publication"}]
