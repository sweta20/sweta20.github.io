However, while AR translation is often used to implement multilingual models that benefit from transfer between languages and from improved serving efficiency, multilingual NAR models remain relatively unexplored. Taking Connectionist Temporal Classification as an example NAR model and IMPUTER as a semi-NAR model, we present a comprehensive empirical study of multilingual NAR. We test its capabilities with respect to positive transfer between related languages and negative transfer under capacity constraints. As NAR models require distilled training sets, we carefully study the impact of bilingual versus multilingual teachers. Finally, we fit a scaling law for multilingual NAR to determine capacity bottlenecks, which quantifies its performance relative to the AR model as the model scale increases.","tags":null,"title":"Exploring the Benefits and Limitations of Multilinguality for Non-autoregressive Machine Translation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Elijah Rippeth","Sweta Agrawal","Marine Carpuat"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1652400000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652400000,"objectID":"d0995816d32308a75bddd57be5b7f3a8","permalink":"/publication/formality/","publishdate":"2022-05-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/formality/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper describes the University of Maryland’s submission to the Special Task on Formality Control for Spoken Language Translation at IWSLT, which evaluates translation from English into 6 languages with diverse grammatical formality markers.

We show that the imitation learning algorithms designed to train such models for machine translation introduces mismatches between training and inference that lead to undertraining and poor generalization in editing scenarios. We address this issue with two complementary strategies: 1) a roll-in policy that exposes the model to intermediate training sequences that it is more likely to encounter during inference, 2) a curriculum that presents easy-to-learn edit operations first, gradually increasing the difficulty of training samples as the model becomes competent. We show the efficacy of these strategies on two challenging English editing tasks: controllable text simplification and abstractive summarization. Our approach significantly improves output quality on both tasks and controls output complexity better on the simplification task.","tags":null,"title":"An Imitation Learning Curriculum for Text Editing with Non-Autoregressive Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eleftheria Briakou","Sweta Agrawal","Joel Tetreault","Marine Carpuat"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1630281600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630281600,"objectID":"00824f3ec59110f2f5a5126fb00f9998","permalink":"/publication/fost-auto/","publishdate":"2021-08-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fost-auto/","section":"publication","summary":"While the field of style transfer (ST) has been growing rapidly, it has been hampered by a lack of standardized practices for automatic evaluation.

Unlike the standard machine translation task, STAPLE requires generating a set of outputs for a given input sequence, aiming to cover the space of translations produced by language learners. We adapt neural machine translation models to this requirement by (a) generating n-best translation hypotheses from a model fine-tuned on learner translations, oversampled to reflect the distribution of learner responses, and (b) filtering hypotheses using a feature-rich binary classifier that directly optimizes a close approximation of the official evaluation metric.

Existing works for cyberbullying detection have at least one of the following three bottlenecks. First, they target only one particular social media platform (SMP). Second, they address just one topic of cyberbullying.Third, they rely on carefully handcrafted features of the data. We show that deep learning based models can overcome all three bottlenecks. Knowledge learned by these models on one dataset can be transferred to other datasets. We performed extensive experiments using three real-world datasets: Formspring (~12k posts), Twitter (~16k posts), and Wikipedia(~100k posts). Our experiments provide several useful insights about cyberbullying detection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that systematically analyzes cyberbullying detection on various topics across multiple SMPs using deep learning based models and transfer learning.","tags":null,"title":"Deep Learning for Detecting Cyberbullying Across Multiple Social Media Platforms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ankur Garg","Sunav Choudhary","Payal Bajaj","Sweta Agrawal","Abhishek Kedia","Shubham Agarwal"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1510012800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1510012800,"objectID":"33aacc144cd1618d7582cef0f9094b79","permalink":"/publication/geo-fencing/","publishdate":"2017-11-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/geo-fencing/","section":"publication","summary":"Geo-fencing is a location based service that allows sending of messages to users who enter/exit a specified geographical area, known as a geo-fence. Today, it has become one of the popular location based mobile marketing strategies. However, the process of geofencing is presently manual, i.e. a retailer has to specify the location and the radius of area around it to setup the geo-fences. In addition, this process does not take into account the user’s preference towards the targeted product/service and thus, can compromise his/her experience of the app that sends these communications. We attempt to solve this problem by presenting a novel end-to-end system for automated creation of affnity based smart geo-fences. Affnity towards a product/service refers to the user’s interest in a product/service. Our unique formulation to estimate affnity, using historical app usage data, is sensitive to a user’s location as well and thus, the affnity is termed as location sensitive product affnity (LSPA). The geo-fence logic tries to capture contiguous groups of locations where the affnity high. Experiments on real world ecommerce dataset reveals that geo-fences designed by our approach performs signiffcantly better at accurately targeting the users who are interested in a product. We thus show that, using historical app usage data, geo-fences can be created in an automated manner and help enterprises target interested users with better accuracy as compared to the present industry practices.","tags":null,"title":"Smart Geo-fencing with Location Sensitive Product Affinity","type":"publication"}]
